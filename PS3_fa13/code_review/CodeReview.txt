1. In 30th line of StopwatchFactory.java, don't need put add() in synchronized 
block, because a single operation on sysnchronizedList doesn't need synchronized
protection.

2. The javadoc of getStopwatches method is supposed to clarify the return list 
is an unmodifiableList

3. It's better to use two different locks to synchronized isRunning and laps 
in method lap() in Stopwatch. Or laps can be wrapped by synchronziedList(). In
 this way thread can access the method more efficiently;
